    : execution time for every endpoint
    : Number of requests per endpoint per day
    : number of hits for each endpoint
    : Execution time per version




CI/CD
 - bamboo with bitbucket?
 - Jenkins for free
 - Gitlab, a rising star
 - Travis, free in conjunction with GitHub

How about with docker? Kubernetes? or even Openshift?

- With docker, it is hard to manage.
  disadvantages:
    - no multi-tenant, no guarantee that what i am testing is 100% the same as others
    - all done manually. 한 땀 한땀
    - any problems? be yourself. no support

  advantage:
    - lightweight
    - freeeeeeee unless you buy an enterprise version. (who would do that?)


OpenShift:
  good:
   - multi-tenant, easy to use at least for users. For enterprises!
   - support from Redhat
   - great integration with Jenkins.
   - usually click basis (almost 100% compatible with commands)
   - I believe the best choice ever if you have enough money

  bad:
   - veery expensive
   - arguing it is easy but it's new stuff that system engineers and devOps engineers need to
      learn about and deep down, it's not even easy.
  - Redhat is Redhat. and Redhat Korea it is
